Start: 30/01/2022


Day 1:

name choice
basics of creating an interpreter vs compiler
start on lexer (groups of operators)

Since the actual interpreter will be an instance of 'MikiMiki' object, looked at arrow vs normal funcs (esp 'this' keyword)


Day 2:

Data structures to control memory: stack, queue etc
Possibility to combine func with vars operators
